This is the beginning of a static-first journal on systems, product engineering, and calm clarity.

## What this is

Posts live as Markdown, compile to HTML at build time, and deploy as fully static pages. No runtime parsing, no revalidation, no regeneration.

## What to expect

- Technical deep dives (distributed systems, performance, tooling)
- Short field notes (design decisions, tradeoffs)
- A reading-first layout that stays out of your way
